<h3>K-means Clustering</h3>

<p>This is my first attempt to implement Un-supervised Machine Learning Algorithm -  k-means Clustering.</p>
<p>I picked Citrus Fruit Dataset from Kaggle - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/joshmcadams/oranges-vs-grapefruit">Link to kaggle Dataset</a></p>

<H3>Problem Statement</H3>
<p>Based on multiple features we have to predict whether fruite is ORANGE or GrapeFruit</p>

<h3>Business Relevence</h3>
<p>Similar situation occur when you have to implement recommendation based on certain features/traits</p>
